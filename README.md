## 🎯 What is This?

Lencana Malaysia is not just an information repository; it's a gamified learning platform. We make understanding national honors—like the **Seri Maharaja Mangku Negara (SMN)** or **Pingat Jasa Malaysia (PJM)**—fun and memorable. Users progress through levels, complete quizzes, earn virtual badges, and build a personal collection, all while deepening their appreciation for Malaysian heritage.
